There is no way to access the knowledge generated by computer vision techniques.

The research community has made a lot of efforts to use the computer vision techniques for extracting knowledge from images.  On the other side, not much attention has been paid to the implementation of methods for making this knowledge available.

We hope to change this trend by presenting Semantic Web techniques for using the knowledge made available by computer vision. 



Qanswer provides a front-end which can used easily by any Q


We hope to change this
trend by presenting the first reusable front-end for QA systems over knowledge bases,
i.e. a front-end that can be reused easily by any new QA system. It can currently be

 for how the answer is presented and
how users can interact with a QA system.

increase the F-score over different benchmarks, i.e., the accuracy of the translation
of a natural language question in a formal representation like a SPARQL query. On
the other side not much attention has been paid to how the answer is presented and
how users can interact with a QA system.
